# 911-Call-Data-Capstone-Project

**Tools and Technologies:**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data Wrangling and Cleaning
- Data Visualization

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Data Import and Setup:**
  - Imported and manipulated large datasets using Pandas.
  - Utilized visualization libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn for exploratory data analysis.
  
- **Data Analysis:**
  - Conducted initial data exploration, including checking data types, identifying unique values, and summarizing key statistics.
  - Identified and analyzed the top 5 zip codes and townships for 911 calls.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Extracted and created new features from existing data (e.g., `Reason` for 911 call from `title` column).
  - Converted timestamp strings to DateTime objects and derived new time-based features (Hour, Month, Day of Week).

- **Data Visualization:**
  - Created various plots to visualize the distribution and frequency of 911 calls by different categories (e.g., Reason, Day of Week, Month).
  - Developed count plots, line plots, and heatmaps to illustrate trends and patterns in the data.
  - Utilized Seabornâ€™s `countplot`, `lmplot`, `heatmap`, and `clustermap` for comprehensive visual analysis.

- **Time Series Analysis:**
  - Performed groupby operations to aggregate call data by date, month, and time of day.
  - Created time series plots to observe daily, monthly, and hourly trends in 911 calls.
  
- **Advanced Visualization Techniques:**
  - Constructed heatmaps and cluster maps to analyze call frequencies across different time intervals.
  - Utilized unstacking techniques to reformat data for advanced visualizations.

**Achievements:**
- Successfully identified patterns and insights from complex datasets.
- Demonstrated ability to transform raw data into meaningful visual representations for improved understanding and decision-making.
- Showcased proficiency in Python for data analysis and visualization, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of emergency call trends.
